Stop hunting through sketchy websites and managing endless browser tabs. **Game Cheats Manager (GCM)** brings single-player game trainers from multiple sources into one clean, open-source dashboard. Search in English or Chinese, download with one click, and let the app handle the rest.

## Core Features

### Multiple Sources, One App
Get access to the most trusted trainers in the community without dealing with dead links:
* **Fling Trainers:** The industry standard.
* **XiaoXing Trainers:** Specialized in Asia-focused titles with advanced features.
* **Cheat Tables:** A vast repository of community-created tables for Cheat Engine.
* **GCM Trainers:** Personally curated, open-source trainers for niche titles.
* **Community Uploaded Trainers:** Trainers submitted directly by our users. Whether you've created your own or found one missing from our main sources, these are manually reviewed for safety before becoming available to everyone.

### Instant Bilingual Search
Type a game name in English or Chinese to see instant results. Data syncs locally across all sources so you can filter by source or game without lag.

### Double-Click to Download
Found your trainer? Double-click it. GCM handles the download, unzips the files, tags the version, and organizes it into a named folder—all while protecting against duplicates.

### Auto-Update on Every Launch
Game updates break trainers fast. GCM checks for updates silently in the background every time you launch the app, ensuring your library is always current.

### Windows Defender Integration
Because trainers modify game memory, they often trigger false-positive antivirus alerts. GCM includes a one-click whitelist helper to safely add your trainer folders to Windows Defender exclusions.

### Anti-Cheat Smart Alerts
For single-player games that still utilize anti-cheat, GCM provides step-by-step bypass instructions immediately after your download finishes.

### Community Powered
Created your own trainer or found one we missed? Upload it directly through the app. After a manual safety review, your contribution goes live to the entire community.
